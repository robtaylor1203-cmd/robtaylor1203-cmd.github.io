    "commentary_synthesized": "Auction offerings declined to 5.1 M/Kgs. Good general demand prevailed, particularly for Ex-Estate teas which met with good demand at mostly firm to dearer rates. [Ex-Estate] Overall quality from Western slopes was marginally improved. Best Western BOP/BOPFs gained up to Rs. 50/kg and Rs. 20-40/kg respectively, with Below Best and Plainer sorts also appreciating. Nuwara Eliyas were a weak feature, mostly remaining unsold. Uva's were limited to non-seasonal teas which sold around last week's levels. [Low Growns] Comprising 2.1 M/Kgs, this segment met with fair but lower demand. In the Leafy/Semi-Leafy catalogues, well-made BOP1s were firm while others appreciated. OP1s were firm to dearer. In the Tippy catalogue, FBOPs and FF1s were generally lower to easier. [CTC] High & Medium grown PF1s were mostly firm while Low Growns sold well. [Source: Forbes & Walker, TMR]",
