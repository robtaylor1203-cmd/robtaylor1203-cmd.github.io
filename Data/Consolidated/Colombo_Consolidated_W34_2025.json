    "commentary_synthesized": "Auction offerings declined to 5.1 M/Kgs, with good general demand prevailing, likely triggered by the restricted availability. [Ex-Estate] Quality from the Western slopes was selectively brighter. Best Western BOPs saw select invoices gain up to Rs. 50/kg, with BOPFs firm to dearer by Rs. 20-40/kg. Below Best and Plainer sorts also appreciated. Nuwara Eliyas were a weak feature and mostly unsold. Uva's were limited to non-seasonal teas which sold around last week's levels. [Low Growns] Approximately 2.1 M/Kgs on offer met with fair demand. In the Leafy catalogues, well-made BOP1s/OP1s were firm to dearer, while OPs/OPAs were easier. Pekoe/Pekoe1s were irregular and mostly lower. In the Tippy catalogues, FBOPs/FF1s were generally easier. [CTC] High & Medium grown PF1s were mostly firm, while Low Growns sold well.

      "analysis": "The substantial gains for the best available Westerns (up to Rs. 50/kg) alongside the almost complete lack of demand for Nuwara Eliyas highlights a strong flight to quality. Buyers are willing to pay for good leaf appearance and liquor, while plainer sorts struggle."

      "sentiment": "Bearish",
      "outlook": "Prices for smaller leaf and tippy grades are likely to remain under pressure.",
      "analysis": "While leafy grades (BOP1/OP1) saw firm to dearer rates, the majority of other categories, especially Pekoe/Pekoe1s and FBOP/FF1s, were reported as irregular and mostly easier. This suggests an oversupply or waning demand for these specific grades."
