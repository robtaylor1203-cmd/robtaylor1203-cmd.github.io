Approximately 22-23% remained unsold. [Source: Combrok, Atlas] There was strong activity from Pakistan Packers, Bazaar, and Afghanistan. UK, Yemen, and other Middle Eastern countries showed good interest. Egyptian packers showed less inquiry, while Sudan and Iran were quiet. CIS countries were active but selective. [Source: Atlas] Flavory BP1s saw less demand, easing significantly (USC 10-60+). Brighter/Colory types were irregular. Medium/Plainer types were well absorbed. PF1s maintained the best absorption overall. PDUSTs and DUST1s saw varied demand, with brighter types generally performing well. Secondaries were irregular, while BMFs maintained good absorption.
