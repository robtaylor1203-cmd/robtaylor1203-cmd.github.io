The Medium and Plainer types were well absorbed at firm to USC 18 easier, with a few improved invoices dearer by a few cents."},

The Colory types registered improved demand at firm to USC 9 dearer and up to USC 17 easier, though several reprinted invoices remained unsold. The Medium and Plainer types were well absorbed at irregular levels, with prices ranging from firm to USC 15 dearer and easier by a similar margin."},
    {"grade": "PDUST", "comment": "The Flavory PDUSTs held firm to USC 11 dearer, while brighter types gained USC 8-40 dearer, with minimal invoices neglected. The Colory types met fair demand at firm to USC 15 dearer, though a few lines eased by a similar margin and reprinted invoices were mainly neglected. The Medium types were barely firm to USC 15 dearer, but a few lines eased by USC 10 on average. The Plainer types sold at firm to USC 11 lower, with several out lots registered."},

    {"grade": "Secondary", "comment": "The BPs were mainly firm to USC 8 dearer and sometimes more, though a few lines lost value by the same margin. The PFs were well absorbed at firm to USC 15 easier while DUSTs and Fannings were irregular, ranging from firm to USC 26 dearer to USC 18 easier, with fewer out lots. BMFs maintained good absorption on the last levels."}
