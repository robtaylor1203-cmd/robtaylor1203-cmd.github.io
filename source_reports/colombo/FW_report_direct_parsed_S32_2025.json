Regional and local packers were selective on the best & good teas. Up country buyers were subdued. Exporters to Russia, Middle east continued to be active on blacker sorts.\n\nORTHODOX DUST\n\nDEMAND: - Continued selective demand.\n\nMARKET: - High grown primary dust fetched irregularly lower prices following quality with few lots facing out lots baring few select invoices sold dearer on competition. Clean, medium grown teas sold dearer whilst others were discounted. Secondaries were barely steady to easier.\n\nBUYING PATTERN: -Regional & local packateers were selective on primary dusts. Exporters were very choosy at steady to easier prices on the secondary dusts.\n\n\nCourtesy - J Thomas & Company Private Limited\n\n\n\n\n SILIGURI\n\nCTC LEAF MARKET REPORT - 20th AUGUST 2025                      \nSTAC OFFERINGS IN PACKAGES (SALE NO 34) \n\n \t\n\n2025-2026\n\n\t\n\n2024-2025\n\n\t\n\nDIFFERENCE\n\n\n\n\nCTC\n\n\t\n\n153,738\n\n\t\n\n136,481\n\n\t\n\n17,257\n\n\n\n\nDARJEELING\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nGREEN\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nDUST\n\n\t\n\n19,561\n\n\t\n\n15,520\n\n\t\n\n4,041\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\t\n\n173,299\n\n\t\n\n152,001\n\n\t\n\n21,298\n\n\nDEMAND / MARKET DETAILS:  Market opened to good demand.
