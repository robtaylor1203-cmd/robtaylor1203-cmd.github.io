Smaller Brokens were fairly well supported at around last levels with only a few lines tending dearer. Plain teas once again met with a discriminating market and there were many withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.\n\nFANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings were in fairly good demand but were easier towards the end. Medium and plain types continued to meet with a discriminating market and prices dropped further with more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.\n \nDUST: 13,541 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand with more withdrawals than last. Good liquoring Dusts were sold at easier levels and had few withdrawals.. Mediums were also an easier market with Tk.5/- to Tk.8/- less than last. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and saw fair withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.\n\nCOMMENTS: There was more tea on offer this week and initially there was fair competition for good liquoring types which were fairly firm but these eased further with the progress of sale. Blenders lent a good support but owing to less competition from the Loose tea buyers particularly from the latter half of the sale and rates declined steadily.\n\nDusts were again an easier market.\n\nOur Catalogue: (Sale 14) Avg : Tk 247.12, Sold 70.58% , (Sale 13) Avg : Tk 249.74 , Sold 73.15%\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nBROKENS\n\n\t\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n2.11-2.15\n\n\t\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n          2.06-2.11\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n2.05-2.09\n\n\t\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n2.03-2.05\n\n\t\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n2.02\n\n\t\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.53-1.82\n\n\t\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.53-1.85\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED\n\n\n \n\n\n \nMALAWI AUCTION\n\nSALE OF - 06 AUGUST 2025 (SALE 32)\n\n\n\nThere was improved demand generally firm to dearer rates following quality for the 3140 packages on offer.\nBP1 - N/A.\nPF1 were firm on last where sold.\nPD sold 3USC up on last.\nD1 tended firm to 3USC dearer.\nPF1SC - N/A\nSecondaries were generally firm on last.\n\nCourtesy - TEA BROKERS CENTRAL AFRICA LIMITED\n\n\n \nCOONOOR AUCTION\n\nSALE OF - 06 AUGUST 2025 (SALE 32)\n\n\n\nSILIGURI\n\nCTC LEAF MARKET REPORT                  \n \nSTAC OFFERINGS IN PACKAGES\n\n \n\n\t\n\n2025-2026\n\n\t\n\n2024-2025\n\n\t\n\nDIFFERENCE\n\n\n\n\nCTC\n\n\t\n\n160,597\n\n\t\n\n107,210\n\n\t\n\n53,387\n\n\n\n\nDARJEELING\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nGREEN\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nDUST\n\n\t\n\n17,475\n\n\t\n\n15,337\n\n\t\n\n2,138\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\t\n\n178,072\n\n\t\n\n122,547\n\n\t\n\n55,525\n\n\nDEMAND / MARKET DETAILS:  Market opened to good demand.

Smaller Brokens were fairly well supported at around last levels with only a few lines tending dearer. Plain teas once again met with a discriminating market and there were many withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.FANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings were in fairly good demand but were easier towards the end. Medium and plain types continued to meet with a discriminating market and prices dropped further with more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week. DUST: 13,541 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand with more withdrawals than last. Good liquoring Dusts were sold at easier levels and had few withdrawals.. Mediums were also an easier market with Tk.5/- to Tk.8/- less than last. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and saw fair withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.COMMENTS: There was more tea on offer this week and initially there was fair competition for good liquoring types which were fairly firm but these eased further with the progress of sale. Blenders lent a good support but owing to less competition from the Loose tea buyers particularly from the latter half of the sale and rates declined steadily.Dusts were again an easier market.Our Catalogue: (Sale 14) Avg : Tk 247.12, Sold 70.58% , (Sale 13) Avg : Tk 249.74 , Sold 73.15%\n\n\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nBROKENS\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n2.11-2.15\n\n\nBest\n\n\n          2.06-2.11\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.05-2.09\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.03-2.05\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.53-1.82\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.53-1.85\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED \n \n        \n        \n             \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n            MALAWI AUCTION\n        \n        \n            SALE OF - 06 AUGUST 2025 (SALE 32)\n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n            There was improved demand generally firm to dearer rates following quality for the 3140 packages on offer.BP1 - N/A.PF1 were firm on last where sold.PD sold 3USC up on last.D1 tended firm to 3USC dearer.PF1SC - N/ASecondaries were generally firm on last.Courtesy - TEA BROKERS CENTRAL AFRICA LIMITED\n        \n        \n             \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n            COONOOR AUCTION\n        \n        \n            SALE OF - 06 AUGUST 2025 (SALE 32)\n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n            SILIGURI \nCTC LEAF MARKET REPORT                    STAC OFFERINGS IN PACKAGES \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2025-2026\n\n\n2024-2025\n\n\nDIFFERENCE\n\n\n\n\nCTC\n\n\n160,597\n\n\n107,210\n\n\n53,387\n\n\n\n\nDARJEELING\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nGREEN\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nDUST\n\n\n17,475\n\n\n15,337\n\n\n2,138\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\n178,072\n\n\n122,547\n\n\n55,525\n\n\n\n\nDEMAND / MARKET DETAILS:  Market opened to good demand.

            "CTC LEAF: 54,162 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand which slackened as the sale progressed.BROKENS: Large Brokens met with fair interest but prices were easier than last. Smaller Brokens were fairly well supported at around last levels with only a few lines tending dearer. Plain teas once again met with a discriminating market and there were many withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.FANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings were in fairly good demand but were easier towards the end. Medium and plain types continued to meet with a discriminating market and prices dropped further with more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week. DUST: 13,541 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand with more withdrawals than last. Good liquoring Dusts were sold at easier levels and had few withdrawals.. Mediums were also an easier market with Tk.5/- to Tk.8/- less than last. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and saw fair withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.COMMENTS: There was more tea on offer this week and initially there was fair competition for good liquoring types which were fairly firm but these eased further with the progress of sale. Blenders lent a good support but owing to less competition from the Loose tea buyers particularly from the latter half of the sale and rates declined steadily.Dusts were again an easier market.Our Catalogue: (Sale 14) Avg : Tk 247.12, Sold 70.58% , (Sale 13) Avg : Tk 249.74 , Sold 73.15%\n\n\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nBROKENS\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n2.11-2.15\n\n\nBest\n\n\n          2.06-2.11\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.05-2.09\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.03-2.05\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.53-1.82\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.53-1.85\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED \n ",

Smaller Brokens were fairly well supported at around last levels with only a few lines tending dearer. Plain teas once again met with a discriminating market and there were many withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.FANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings were in fairly good demand but were easier towards the end. Medium and plain types continued to meet with a discriminating market and prices dropped further with more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week. DUST: 13,541 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand with more withdrawals than last. Good liquoring Dusts were sold at easier levels and had few withdrawals.. Mediums were also an easier market with Tk.5/- to Tk.8/- less than last. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and saw fair withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.COMMENTS: There was more tea on offer this week and initially there was fair competition for good liquoring types which were fairly firm but these eased further with the progress of sale. Blenders lent a good support but owing to less competition from the Loose tea buyers particularly from the latter half of the sale and rates declined steadily.Dusts were again an easier market.Our Catalogue: (Sale 14) Avg : Tk 247.12, Sold 70.58% , (Sale 13) Avg : Tk 249.74 , Sold 73.15%\n\n\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nBROKENS\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n2.11-2.15\n\n\nBest\n\n\n          2.06-2.11\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.05-2.09\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.03-2.05\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.53-1.82\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.53-1.85\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED \n ",

Smaller Brokens were fairly well supported at around last levels with only a few lines tending dearer. Plain teas once again met with a discriminating market and there were many withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.\n\nFANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings were in fairly good demand but were easier towards the end. Medium and plain types continued to meet with a discriminating market and prices dropped further with more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.\n \nDUST: 13,541 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand with more withdrawals than last. Good liquoring Dusts were sold at easier levels and had few withdrawals.. Mediums were also an easier market with Tk.5/- to Tk.8/- less than last. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and saw fair withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.\n\nCOMMENTS: There was more tea on offer this week and initially there was fair competition for good liquoring types which were fairly firm but these eased further with the progress of sale. Blenders lent a good support but owing to less competition from the Loose tea buyers particularly from the latter half of the sale and rates declined steadily.\n\nDusts were again an easier market.\n\nOur Catalogue: (Sale 14) Avg : Tk 247.12, Sold 70.58% , (Sale 13) Avg : Tk 249.74 , Sold 73.15%\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nBROKENS\n\n\t\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n2.11-2.15\n\n\t\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n          2.06-2.11\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n2.05-2.09\n\n\t\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n2.03-2.05\n\n\t\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n2.02\n\n\t\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.53-1.82\n\n\t\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.53-1.85\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED\n\n\n \n\n\n \nMALAWI AUCTION\n\nSALE OF - 06 AUGUST 2025 (SALE 32)\n\n\n\nThere was improved demand generally firm to dearer rates following quality for the 3140 packages on offer.\nBP1 - N/A.\nPF1 were firm on last where sold.\nPD sold 3USC up on last.\nD1 tended firm to 3USC dearer.\nPF1SC - N/A\nSecondaries were generally firm on last.\n\nCourtesy - TEA BROKERS CENTRAL AFRICA LIMITED\n\n\n \nCOONOOR AUCTION\n\nSALE OF - 06 AUGUST 2025 (SALE 32)\n\n\n\nSILIGURI\n\nCTC LEAF MARKET REPORT                  \n \nSTAC OFFERINGS IN PACKAGES\n\n \n\n\t\n\n2025-2026\n\n\t\n\n2024-2025\n\n\t\n\nDIFFERENCE\n\n\n\n\nCTC\n\n\t\n\n160,597\n\n\t\n\n107,210\n\n\t\n\n53,387\n\n\n\n\nDARJEELING\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nGREEN\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nDUST\n\n\t\n\n17,475\n\n\t\n\n15,337\n\n\t\n\n2,138\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\t\n\n178,072\n\n\t\n\n122,547\n\n\t\n\n55,525\n\n\nDEMAND / MARKET DETAILS:  Market opened to good demand.

            "CTC LEAF: 54,162 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand which slackened as the sale progressed.BROKENS: Large Brokens met with fair interest but prices were easier than last. Smaller Brokens were fairly well supported at around last levels with only a few lines tending dearer. Plain teas once again met with a discriminating market and there were many withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.FANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings were in fairly good demand but were easier towards the end. Medium and plain types continued to meet with a discriminating market and prices dropped further with more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week. DUST: 13,541 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand with more withdrawals than last. Good liquoring Dusts were sold at easier levels and had few withdrawals.. Mediums were also an easier market with Tk.5/- to Tk.8/- less than last. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and saw fair withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.COMMENTS: There was more tea on offer this week and initially there was fair competition for good liquoring types which were fairly firm but these eased further with the progress of sale. Blenders lent a good support but owing to less competition from the Loose tea buyers particularly from the latter half of the sale and rates declined steadily.Dusts were again an easier market.Our Catalogue: (Sale 14) Avg : Tk 247.12, Sold 70.58% , (Sale 13) Avg : Tk 249.74 , Sold 73.15%\n\n\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nBROKENS\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n2.11-2.15\n\n\nBest\n\n\n          2.06-2.11\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.05-2.09\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.03-2.05\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.53-1.82\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.53-1.85\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED \n ",

Smaller Brokens were fairly well supported at around last levels with only a few lines tending dearer. Plain teas once again met with a discriminating market and there were many withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.\n\nFANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings were in fairly good demand but were easier towards the end. Medium and plain types continued to meet with a discriminating market and prices dropped further with more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with quite a good demand but there were more withdrawals this week.\n \nDUST: 13,541 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand with more withdrawals than last. Good liquoring Dusts were sold at easier levels and had few withdrawals.. Mediums were also an easier market with Tk.5/- to Tk.8/- less than last. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and saw fair withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.\n\nCOMMENTS: There was more tea on offer this week and initially there was fair competition for good liquoring types which were fairly firm but these eased further with the progress of sale. Blenders lent a good support but owing to less competition from the Loose tea buyers particularly from the latter half of the sale and rates declined steadily.\n\nDusts were again an easier market.\n\nOur Catalogue: (Sale 14) Avg : Tk 247.12, Sold 70.58% , (Sale 13) Avg : Tk 249.74 , Sold 73.15%\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nBROKENS\n\n\t\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n2.11-2.15\n\n\t\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n          2.06-2.11\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n2.05-2.09\n\n\t\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n2.03-2.05\n\n\t\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n2.02\n\n\t\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.53-1.82\n\n\t\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.53-1.85\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED\n\n\n \n\n\n "
