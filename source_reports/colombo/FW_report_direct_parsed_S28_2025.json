Reduced demand on plainer teas.\n\nMARKET: - Very limited volume of teas were on offer from the best & good tea segment which sold at irregular levels. Better\nmedium declined by Rs 2-4., medium sorts were barely steady to easier. Lower medium and plainer teas continue to face withdrawals with very limited weight of teas sold at Rs 2-4 lower than last.\n\nBUYING PATTERN: - Major blenders were the mainstay of the market with 50.23% off take of the entire CTC sold. Regional buyers were selective on the best and good liquoring sorts. Internal buyers continued to be subdued. Middle east and Russian exporters continued to be fairly active on blacker sorts. Select Iraqi buying was witnessed.\n\nORTHODOX LEAF\n\nDemand:- Good Demand.\n\nMarket:- All teas sold barely steady to easier except for the fanning grade which saw larger discount compared to last week.\n\nBuying Pattern:- Russian and CIS buyers were selective active along with Internal buyers.Middle east shippers lent fair support on whole leaf grades and broken.\n\n\nCTC DUST\n\nDEMAND: - Selective or rather subdued on best & good teas, fair for the better medium, reduced demand for the remainders.\n\nMARKET: - CTC dust offer this week was at 530,490.91Kgs of which 388,110.55kgs were sold (73.16%). Limited quantity of Best & good teas sold substantially easier. Better medium teas sold easier by Rs 2 to 4 or more, others too eased by Rs 2 to 4 with continued out list on the lower medium and plainer teas especially, the browner sorts.\n\nBUYING PATTERN: - Major blenders continued to be very choosy. Regional and local packeteers were less active on the best & good teas. Up country buyers were subdued. Exporters to Russia, Middle east were selective this week on blacker sorts.\n\nORTHODOX DUST\n\nDEMAND: - Good demand on primary at easier prices compared to last, fair on the Medium grown & secondaries.\n\nMARKET: - High grown primary dust fetched easier prices with lack of the lone up country buyer who operated strongly last week., medium grown sold irregularly easier. Secondaries sold easier with fair withdrawals.\n\nBUYING PATTERN: -Regional & local packateers were fairly active on primary dusts. Exporters were very choosy at easier\n\nCourtesy J.Thomas & Co.
