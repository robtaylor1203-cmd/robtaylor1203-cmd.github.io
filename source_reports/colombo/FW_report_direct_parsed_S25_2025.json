Following the Iran-Israel ceasefire, a greater degree of stability was witnessed in the market and an upward trend in prices all round.\nEx-Estate offerings totalled 0.83 M/Kgs and here again, marginally lower to the 0.86 M/Kgs on offer the previous week. Overall quality of teas on offer were slightly preferable to last.\nImproved demand, particularly for the better Westerns, which appreciated by Rs. 50-100 per kg and more. Prices at the lower end of the market for the BOP's were weak and were firm to Rs. 50 per kg easier in most instances. Corresponding BOPF's often appreciated by a similar margin widening the price parity at the lower end between BOP/BOPF's greatly in favour of the latter. Nuwara Eliya BOP/BOPF's were mostly unsold in the backdrop of weak quality. Uda Pussellawas' were firm and easier, whilst the Uva BOP/BOPF's were firm and dearer and here again, particularly for BOPF grade.\nCTC teas - BP1's had hardly any offerings. PF1's - High & Mid Growns were firm and up to Rs. 50 per kg dearer for the better teas, whilst the Low Growns continued to sell well at firm to marginally dearer rates.\nIt was heartening to witness the better teas realising substantial price gains vis-à-vis their poorer counterparts and a significant price parity between the two would certainly be of encouragement to producers of good quality teas.\nSelective buying on account of shippers to the UK and the continent. Shippers to Japan, China and South Africa were reasonably active, whilst shippers to the CIS and the Middle East lent good support.\nFrom a global perspective, there appears to be a dearth of good quality teas vis-à-vis the plainer/poorer counterparts and in these circumstances with overall volumes showing a decline, tea prices are likely to remain buoyant in the forthcoming sales.\nLow Growns totalled approximately 2.5 M/Kgs. All categories met with good demand.\nIn the Leafy and Semi-Leafy catalogues, Select Best and Best BOP1's were firm to dearer, whilst the balance together with the bolder varieties sold around last levels. Well-made OP1's appreciated, whilst the balance eased. Well-made OP's together with cleaner Below Best and shorter varieties were dearer. However, the balance together with the mixed/open varieties were irregular. Well-made OPA's were dearer, whilst the balance maintained at last levels.  Select Best and Best PEK's were firm to dearer, whilst the balance together with the mixed/open varieties were easier. Teas at the bottom sold around last levels. Well-made PEK1's appreciated, whilst the balance sold around last levels.\nIn the Tippy catalogue, well-made FBOP's together with the cleaner Below Best and cleaner teas at the bottom appreciated, whilst the balance were firm on last. Select Best FF1's were firm, whilst the Best and Below Best varieties together with cleaner teas at the bottom were dearer. The balance sold around last levels.\nIn the Premium catalogue, Very Tippy teas together with the Best and Below Best varieties met with good demand and were dearer, whilst the balance too appreciated to a lesser extent.\nNOTE\nNext week's Auction (Sale No. 26) is scheduled for Monday, 7 July and Tuesday, 8 July 2025\nNATIONAL TEA SALE AVERAGES - JUNE 2025\nKey Highlights:\n*\nTotal Elevation Average declined by Rs. 48.05 in comparison to the previous month\n*\nCumulative variance recorded a negative Rs. 107.13 and USD 0.23 against January-June 2024\n* All elevations recorded negative variances both in LKR and USD terms month on month and cumulatively\nNOTE: The USD values are provisional\n* National tea sales average for the month of June 2025 recorded Rs. 1,103.27 (USD 3.68), recording a decline of Rs. 48.05 (USD 0.17) in comparison with the May 2025 average of Rs. 1,151.32 (USD 3.85).\n* In comparison to the June 2024 average of Rs. 1,243.69 (USD 4.09), shows a decline of Rs. 140.42 (USD 0.41) YOY.\n* Total National Sale Average for the year 2025 (to-date) was recorded at Rs. 1,158.54 (USD 3.89), a decline of Rs. 107.13 (USD 0.23) against the corresponding year's average of Rs. 1,265.67 (USD 4.12).\nElevation-Wise Analysis - June 2025:\n* High Grown average in June 2025 recorded a decrease of Rs. 41.79 and USD 0.15 month on month, whilst a decline of Rs. 136.15 and USD 0.41 was witnessed vis-à-vis June 2024.\n* Medium Grown average in June 2025 recorded a negative variance of Rs. 37.70 and USD 0.13 month on month, whilst a decline of Rs. 100.69 and USD 0.29 was witnessed vis-à-vis June 2024.\n* Low Grown average in June 2025 recorded a decrease of Rs. 53.31 and USD 0.18\nmonth on month, whilst showing a decrease\nof Rs. 149.46 and USD 0.44 vis-à-vis June 2024.\n* All regions recorded negative variances during the period January-June 2025 in comparison to the cumulative corresponding period of 2024 both in LKR and USD terms.\n(Refer statistical details on Page No. 9)\nWorld Tea News\nFORBES & WALKER TEA BROKERS (PVT) LTD SALE OF - 01ST/ 02ND JULY 2025\nForbes and Walker Tea Brokers\nMOST COMPREHENSIVE WEBSITE ON TEA\nwww.forbestea.com\nPage 3\nPage 3\nMARKET\nA selection of better teas appreciated further, whilst the others were irregular\nHIGH GROWN TEAS\nBOP\nWestern's in the Best and Below Best categories - A selection of teas gained by Rs. 100-200 per kg following special inquiry, whilst the others were irregular.
