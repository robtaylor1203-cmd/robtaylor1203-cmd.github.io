A few lots failed to find buyers, primarily due to reserve levels being above market acceptance or lack of demand for that style.\nWithdrawals were mainly confined to plainer and medium lines where reserve prices were above trade levels, reflecting selective buyer interest, with exporters and blenders choosing only better-made teas. The unsold position underscores a cautious approach from buyers in lower-end categories.\nOverall, the market showed a steady undertone. Liquoring Orthodox grades remained the focus of demand led by the ME channel, while the CIS shippers provided fair support. Plainer teas struggled, leading to isolated withdrawals, but quality lines continued to fetch firm to dearer levels.\n\nMarket Report - CTC Teas\n\nThe CTC market showed a generally steady to firm trend.\nThere was selective improvement in demand for well-made liquoring lines which were well absorbed. Plainer and medium sorts witnessed fair absorption at easier rates, while certain marks faced resistance, resulting in a few withdrawals.\n\nCourtesy - J.T.

A few lots failed to find buyers, primarily due to reserve levels being above market acceptance or lack of demand for that style.Withdrawals were mainly confined to plainer and medium lines where reserve prices were above trade levels, reflecting selective buyer interest, with exporters and blenders choosing only better-made teas. The unsold position underscores a cautious approach from buyers in lower-end categories.Overall, the market showed a steady undertone. Liquoring Orthodox grades remained the focus of demand led by the ME channel, while the CIS shippers provided fair support. Plainer teas struggled, leading to isolated withdrawals, but quality lines continued to fetch firm to dearer levels.Market Report - CTC TeasThe CTC market showed a generally steady to firm trend.There was selective improvement in demand for well-made liquoring lines which were well absorbed. Plainer and medium sorts witnessed fair absorption at easier rates, while certain marks faced resistance, resulting in a few withdrawals.Courtesy - J.T.

A few lots failed to find buyers, primarily due to reserve levels being above market acceptance or lack of demand for that style.Withdrawals were mainly confined to plainer and medium lines where reserve prices were above trade levels, reflecting selective buyer interest, with exporters and blenders choosing only better-made teas. The unsold position underscores a cautious approach from buyers in lower-end categories.Overall, the market showed a steady undertone. Liquoring Orthodox grades remained the focus of demand led by the ME channel, while the CIS shippers provided fair support. Plainer teas struggled, leading to isolated withdrawals, but quality lines continued to fetch firm to dearer levels.Market Report - CTC TeasThe CTC market showed a generally steady to firm trend.There was selective improvement in demand for well-made liquoring lines which were well absorbed. Plainer and medium sorts witnessed fair absorption at easier rates, while certain marks faced resistance, resulting in a few withdrawals.Courtesy - J.T. COCHIN",

A few lots failed to find buyers, primarily due to reserve levels being above market acceptance or lack of demand for that style.Withdrawals were mainly confined to plainer and medium lines where reserve prices were above trade levels, reflecting selective buyer interest, with exporters and blenders choosing only better-made teas. The unsold position underscores a cautious approach from buyers in lower-end categories.Overall, the market showed a steady undertone. Liquoring Orthodox grades remained the focus of demand led by the ME channel, while the CIS shippers provided fair support. Plainer teas struggled, leading to isolated withdrawals, but quality lines continued to fetch firm to dearer levels.Market Report - CTC TeasThe CTC market showed a generally steady to firm trend.There was selective improvement in demand for well-made liquoring lines which were well absorbed. Plainer and medium sorts witnessed fair absorption at easier rates, while certain marks faced resistance, resulting in a few withdrawals.Courtesy - J.T. COCHIN",

A few lots failed to find buyers, primarily due to reserve levels being above market acceptance or lack of demand for that style.\nWithdrawals were mainly confined to plainer and medium lines where reserve prices were above trade levels, reflecting selective buyer interest, with exporters and blenders choosing only better-made teas. The unsold position underscores a cautious approach from buyers in lower-end categories.\nOverall, the market showed a steady undertone. Liquoring Orthodox grades remained the focus of demand led by the ME channel, while the CIS shippers provided fair support. Plainer teas struggled, leading to isolated withdrawals, but quality lines continued to fetch firm to dearer levels.\n\nMarket Report - CTC Teas\n\nThe CTC market showed a generally steady to firm trend.\nThere was selective improvement in demand for well-made liquoring lines which were well absorbed. Plainer and medium sorts witnessed fair absorption at easier rates, while certain marks faced resistance, resulting in a few withdrawals.\n\nCourtesy - J.T. COCHIN\n\n\n "

A few lots failed to find buyers, primarily due to reserve levels being above market acceptance or lack of demand for that style.Withdrawals were mainly confined to plainer and medium lines where reserve prices were above trade levels, reflecting selective buyer interest, with exporters and blenders choosing only better-made teas. The unsold position underscores a cautious approach from buyers in lower-end categories.Overall, the market showed a steady undertone. Liquoring Orthodox grades remained the focus of demand led by the ME channel, while the CIS shippers provided fair support. Plainer teas struggled, leading to isolated withdrawals, but quality lines continued to fetch firm to dearer levels.Market Report - CTC TeasThe CTC market showed a generally steady to firm trend.There was selective improvement in demand for well-made liquoring lines which were well absorbed. Plainer and medium sorts witnessed fair absorption at easier rates, while certain marks faced resistance, resulting in a few withdrawals.Courtesy - J.T. COCHIN",

A few lots failed to find buyers, primarily due to reserve levels being above market acceptance or lack of demand for that style.\nWithdrawals were mainly confined to plainer and medium lines where reserve prices were above trade levels, reflecting selective buyer interest, with exporters and blenders choosing only better-made teas. The unsold position underscores a cautious approach from buyers in lower-end categories.\nOverall, the market showed a steady undertone. Liquoring Orthodox grades remained the focus of demand led by the ME channel, while the CIS shippers provided fair support. Plainer teas struggled, leading to isolated withdrawals, but quality lines continued to fetch firm to dearer levels.\n\nMarket Report - CTC Teas\n\nThe CTC market showed a generally steady to firm trend.\nThere was selective improvement in demand for well-made liquoring lines which were well absorbed. Plainer and medium sorts witnessed fair absorption at easier rates, while certain marks faced resistance, resulting in a few withdrawals.\n\nCourtesy - J.T. COCHIN\n\n\n "

A few lots failed to find buyers, primarily due to reserve levels being above market acceptance or lack of demand for that style.\nWithdrawals were mainly confined to plainer and medium lines where reserve prices were above trade levels, reflecting selective buyer interest, with exporters and blenders choosing only better-made teas. The unsold position underscores a cautious approach from buyers in lower-end categories.\nOverall, the market showed a steady undertone. Liquoring Orthodox grades remained the focus of demand led by the ME channel, while the CIS shippers provided fair support. Plainer teas struggled, leading to isolated withdrawals, but quality lines continued to fetch firm to dearer levels.\nMarket Report - CTC Teas\nThe CTC market showed a generally steady to firm trend.\nThere was selective improvement in demand for well-made liquoring lines which were well absorbed. Plainer and medium sorts witnessed fair absorption at easier rates, while certain marks faced resistance, resulting in a few withdrawals.\nCourtesy - J.T.
