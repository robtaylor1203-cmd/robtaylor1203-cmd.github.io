Modest volume of best teas were on offer and teas appreciated in value substantially following quality and competition, fanning grades were not on offer. Good category teas also gained dearer prices following quality, except for medium broken at the lower end which saw a slight decline of up to Rs 3.

All the other sorts sold easier by Rs 3 to 5. Fanning sold at steady levels. Medium category teas sold barely steady to easier however, few smaller broken at the top end fetched prices equivalent or more to the better medium categories. The medium broken (especially BOP) and fanning grades found less takers and faced withdrawals. Plainer category teas sold at barely steady on few invoices but generally declined by Rs 3 to 5 with BOP and Fanning grades remaining unsold in large percentage.\nBUYING PATTERN:  \nThe major blenders absorbed 00.00% of the total CTC leaf sold.

Modest volume of best teas were on offer and teas appreciated in value substantially following quality and competition, fanning grades were not on offer. Good category teas also gained dearer prices following quality, except for medium broken at the lower end which saw a slight decline of up to Rs 3. However, the fanning grade offer was bare minimum in this category. Better medium larger & medium broken sold at irregular levels with few top end invoices fetching dearer prices on competition. All the other sorts sold easier by Rs 3 to 5. Fanning sold at steady levels. Medium category teas sold barely steady to easier however, few smaller broken at the top end fetched prices equivalent or more to the better medium categories. The medium broken (especially BOP) and fanning grades found less takers and faced withdrawals. Plainer category teas sold at barely steady on few invoices but generally declined by Rs 3 to 5 with BOP and Fanning grades remaining unsold in large percentage.\nBUYING PATTERN:  \nThe major blenders absorbed 00.00% of the total CTC leaf sold. Regional packateers were active on the best & good teas but selective on the remainders. Up country buyers and local traders were fairly active. Exporters were selective on their purchases.\nORTHODOX LEAF\nDEMAND:  \nGood demand continues to persist especially on the well made, cleaner teas.\nMARKET: \nThe whole leaf grades sold firm to dearer with more handsome gains on the blacker well made teas. Broken grades too met with similar trend. Fanning sold at fully firm to occasionally dearer.\nBUYING PATTERN:\nExporters were fairly active on all sorts. Internal traders were selective on their buying on broken and fanning .\nCTC DUST\nDEMAND: \nGood General Demand.\nMARKET:  \nCTC dust offer this week was at 472,384.36Kgs of which 396,534.84kgs were sold (83.94%). Small volume of the best category dust on offer sold well and handsome gains were witnessed on select improved invoices. Good category bolder dust sold firm to dearer whilst the finer dust appreciated by Rs 4 to 7 on competition. Better medium dust sold at barely steady prices. Medium and plainer teas sold barely steady to easier by up to Rs 3 to 5.\nBUYING PATTERN: \nMajor blenders were selective whilst the local and regional packateers were active especially on best, good and select better medium dust. The up-country buyers were selective. Exporters were rather selective this week on the medium and plainer teas especially on the blacker sorts at barely steady to easier prices.\nORTHODOX DUST\nDEMAND:\nGood demand.\nMARKET:  \nHigh grown primary dust at the lower end was barely steady to easier but well made leafier dust appreciated on competition. Secondary dust sold at steady prices, however powder types were discounted.\nBUYING PATTERN:  \nInternal & regional packateers were active on primary dust. Exporters were selective on the secondary dust.\nCourtesy - J.Thomas & Co.Pvt.

Plainer types were easier with more withdrawals. BLF teas met with less demand and witnessed heavy withdrawals.\nFANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings were a good market and sold around last levels easing slightly. Medium types were easier whilst the plainest eased further with more withdrawals. BLF teas met with less demand and witnessed heavy withdrawals.\nDUST: 9,885 packages of tea on offer met very good demand. Good liquoring Dusts sold well at around last\nlevels. Their Mediums were fully firm to slightly dearer by Tk.3/- to Tk.5/- closely following quality. Plain and BLF Dusts met with a little more interest and had less withdrawals compared to last. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.\nCOMMENTS: There was a little less competition this week resulting in more withdrawals particularly for the plainer types. Blenders continued to be active whilst Loose tea buyers were operating in lesser strength this week.\nDusts were a dearer market.\nOur Catalogue: (Sale 30) Avg : Tk 218.61, Sold 70.52% , (Sale 29) Avg : Tk 216.55, Sold 78.56%\n \n\n\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nBROKENS\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n  1.97-2.02\n\n\nBest\n\n\n1.97-2.02\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n1.85-1.93\n\n\nGood\n\n\n1.85-1.93\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n1.72-1.81\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n1.72-1.81\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n1.47-1.55\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n1.47-1.55\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.34-1.36\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.34-1.36\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy - National Brokers Limited.",

Modest volume of best teas were on offer and teas appreciated in value substantially following quality and competition, fanning grades were not on offer. Good category teas also gained dearer prices following quality, except for medium broken at the lower end which saw a slight decline of up to Rs 3. However, the fanning grade offer was bare minimum in this category. Better medium larger & medium broken sold at irregular levels with few top end invoices fetching dearer prices on competition. All the other sorts sold easier by Rs 3 to 5. Fanning sold at steady levels. Medium category teas sold barely steady to easier however, few smaller broken at the top end fetched prices equivalent or more to the better medium categories. The medium broken (especially BOP) and fanning grades found less takers and faced withdrawals. Plainer category teas sold at barely steady on few invoices but generally declined by Rs 3 to 5 with BOP and Fanning grades remaining unsold in large percentage.\nBUYING PATTERN:  \nThe major blenders absorbed 00.00% of the total CTC leaf sold. Regional packateers were active on the best & good teas but selective on the remainders. Up country buyers and local traders were fairly active. Exporters were selective on their purchases.\nORTHODOX LEAF\nDEMAND:  \nGood demand continues to persist especially on the well made, cleaner teas.\nMARKET: \nThe whole leaf grades sold firm to dearer with more handsome gains on the blacker well made teas. Broken grades too met with similar trend. Fanning sold at fully firm to occasionally dearer.\nBUYING PATTERN:\nExporters were fairly active on all sorts. Internal traders were selective on their buying on broken and fanning .\nCTC DUST\nDEMAND: \nGood General Demand.\nMARKET:  \nCTC dust offer this week was at 472,384.36Kgs of which 396,534.84kgs were sold (83.94%). Small volume of the best category dust on offer sold well and handsome gains were witnessed on select improved invoices. Good category bolder dust sold firm to dearer whilst the finer dust appreciated by Rs 4 to 7 on competition. Better medium dust sold at barely steady prices. Medium and plainer teas sold barely steady to easier by up to Rs 3 to 5.\nBUYING PATTERN: \nMajor blenders were selective whilst the local and regional packateers were active especially on best, good and select better medium dust. The up-country buyers were selective. Exporters were rather selective this week on the medium and plainer teas especially on the blacker sorts at barely steady to easier prices.\nORTHODOX DUST\nDEMAND:\nGood demand.\nMARKET:  \nHigh grown primary dust at the lower end was barely steady to easier but well made leafier dust appreciated on competition. Secondary dust sold at steady prices, however powder types were discounted.\nBUYING PATTERN:  \nInternal & regional packateers were active on primary dust. Exporters were selective on the secondary dust.\nCourtesy - J.Thomas & Co.Pvt.

All the other sorts sold easier by Rs 3 to 5. Fanning sold at steady levels. Medium category teas sold barely steady to easier however, few smaller broken at the top end fetched prices equivalent or more to the better medium categories.

Modest volume of best teas were on offer and teas appreciated in value substantially following quality and competition, fanning grades were not on offer. Good category teas also gained dearer prices following quality, except for medium broken at the lower end which saw a slight decline of up to Rs 3. However, the fanning grade offer was bare minimum in this category. Better medium larger & medium broken sold at irregular levels with few top end invoices fetching dearer prices on competition. All the other sorts sold easier by Rs 3 to 5. Fanning sold at steady levels. Medium category teas sold barely steady to easier however, few smaller broken at the top end fetched prices equivalent or more to the better medium categories. The medium broken (especially BOP) and fanning grades found less takers and faced withdrawals. Plainer category teas sold at barely steady on few invoices but generally declined by Rs 3 to 5 with BOP and Fanning grades remaining unsold in large percentage.\nBUYING PATTERN:  \nThe major blenders absorbed 00.00% of the total CTC leaf sold. Regional packateers were active on the best & good teas but selective on the remainders. Up country buyers and local traders were fairly active. Exporters were selective on their purchases.\nORTHODOX LEAF\nDEMAND:  \nGood demand continues to persist especially on the well made, cleaner teas.\nMARKET: \nThe whole leaf grades sold firm to dearer with more handsome gains on the blacker well made teas. Broken grades too met with similar trend. Fanning sold at fully firm to occasionally dearer.\nBUYING PATTERN:\nExporters were fairly active on all sorts. Internal traders were selective on their buying on broken and fanning .\nCTC DUST\nDEMAND: \nGood General Demand.\nMARKET:  \nCTC dust offer this week was at 472,384.36Kgs of which 396,534.84kgs were sold (83.94%). Small volume of the best category dust on offer sold well and handsome gains were witnessed on select improved invoices. Good category bolder dust sold firm to dearer whilst the finer dust appreciated by Rs 4 to 7 on competition. Better medium dust sold at barely steady prices. Medium and plainer teas sold barely steady to easier by up to Rs 3 to 5.\nBUYING PATTERN: \nMajor blenders were selective whilst the local and regional packateers were active especially on best, good and select better medium dust. The up-country buyers were selective. Exporters were rather selective this week on the medium and plainer teas especially on the blacker sorts at barely steady to easier prices.\nORTHODOX DUST\nDEMAND:\nGood demand.\nMARKET:  \nHigh grown primary dust at the lower end was barely steady to easier but well made leafier dust appreciated on competition.
