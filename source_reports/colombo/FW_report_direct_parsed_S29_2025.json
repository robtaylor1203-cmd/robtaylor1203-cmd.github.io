Withdrawals were negligible in this category. Mediums were firm. Plain descriptions met with some demand and were about steady but there were several withdrawals. BLF teas met with a fairly good demand and were generally firm to occasionally dearer. There were a few withdrawals.\nFANNINGS: Best and good Fannings were a strong feature and were mostly firm whilst Mediums saw a steady demand and prices were also firm on last. Plain varieties saw less demand there were many more withdrawals. BLF teas met with a fairly good demand and were generally firm to occasionally dearer. There were several withdrawals.\n DUST: 13,064 packages of tea on offer met with good demand Good liquoring Dusts sold well at around last levels Medium and plainer sorts were discounted and witnessed fair weight of withdrawals.

Withdrawals were negligible in this category. Mediums were firm. Plain descriptions met with some demand and were about steady but there were several withdrawals. BLF teas met with a fairly good demand and were generally firm to occasionally dearer. There were a few withdrawals.\nFANNINGS: Best and good Fannings were a strong feature and were mostly firm whilst Mediums saw a steady demand and prices were also firm on last. Plain varieties saw less demand there were many more withdrawals. BLF teas met with a fairly good demand and were generally firm to occasionally dearer. There were several withdrawals.\n DUST: 13,064 packages of tea on offer met with good demand Good liquoring Dusts sold well at around last levels Medium and plainer sorts were discounted and witnessed fair weight of withdrawals. BLFs continued to meet with a better demand with only a few withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.\nCOMMENTS: Blenders continued to operate strongly but there was less support from the Loose tea buyers. Buyers once again followed quality closely whereby a selection of plainer types were neglected and were subject to withdrawals.Dusts sold well.\nOur Catalogue: (Sale 12) Avg : Tk 250.85, Sold 76.49% , (Sale 11) Avg : Tk 251.02, Sold 83.40%\n\n\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nBROKENS\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n2.13-2.21\n\n\nBest\n\n\n           2.10-2.17\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.09-2.12\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.07-2.09\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.03-2.07\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.00-2.02\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.00-2.02\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.39-1.79\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.3.9-1.79\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy - National Brokers Limited.
