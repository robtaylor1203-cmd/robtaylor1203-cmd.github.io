BLF teas met with fair demand but there were several withdrawals.\nFANNINGS: All good liquoring Fannings met with a fairly good demand but eased a little whilst Medium types met with fair interest and held last levels. Plain types were in less demand and there were again fair withdrawals. BLF teas met with fair demand but there were several withdrawals. DUST: 13,567 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand. Good liquoring Dusts sold at around last levels. Mediums again were an easier market with Tk.3/- to Tk.5/- less than last. Plain/BLF Dusts were a fair market with some withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.\nCOMMENTS: Blenders were fairly active this week but there was less competition from Loose tea buyers. As a result the absorption was less and consequently there were more withdrawals.Dusts were a fair market.\nOur Catalogue: (Sale 16) Avg : Tk 246.66, Sold 70.73% , (Sale 15) Avg : Tk 245.58, Sold 75.55% \n\n\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nBROKENS\n\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\n2.11-2.14\n\n\nBest\n\n\n          2.09-2.11\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.06-2.09\n\n\nGood\n\n\n2.04-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.04-2.05\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n2.02-2.04\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02-2.03\n\n\nPlain\n\n\n2.02-2.03\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.72-1.98\n\n\nBLF\n\n\n1.73-1.92\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED",

Smaller varieties in this category were well sought after at generally firm rates. Medium and plain types met with a fair demand with more withdrawals. BLF teas met with fair demand but there were several withdrawals.\nFANNINGS: All good liquoring Fannings met with a fairly good demand but eased a little whilst Medium types met with fair interest and held last levels. Plain types were in less demand and there were again fair withdrawals. BLF teas met with fair demand but there were several withdrawals. DUST: 13,567 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand. Good liquoring Dusts sold at around last levels. Mediums again were an easier market with Tk.3/- to Tk.5/- less than last. Plain/BLF Dusts were a fair market with some withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.\nCOMMENTS: Blenders were fairly active this week but there was less competition from Loose tea buyers.
