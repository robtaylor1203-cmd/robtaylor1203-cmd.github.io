Sri Lanka tea crop is unlikely to show any significant gains and is likely to settle around the 255-258 M/Kgs. The continuance of low production remains a concern to the industry which is challenged by the ill effects of climate change, aging tea bushes and the high cost of chemical fertilizer compounded by the irregular usage. In addition, economic difficulties in importer countries have taken its toll from time to time and more recently, the strengthening of the Sri Lankan Rupee has to some extent adversely impacted the rupee tea prices.\nIn this backdrop, the 51\nst\nand final auction of the year concluded today was a one-day restricted sale with a total quantity of 4.0 M/Kgs. Low Grown teas continued to meet with reasonably good demand notwithstanding the price fluctuations within grades, whilst the liquoring teas and particularly the corresponding BOP/BOPF's witnesses less demand, and often an easier trend in prices for most teas on offer.\nEx-Estate offerings totalled 0.68 M/Kgs. Overall quality of teas from the Western slopes were barely maintained with only a handful of useful teas on offer, whilst the teas from the Eastern Sector showed no significant change.\nMuch less demand for the better teas, perhaps a combination of a qualitative factor combined with less activity from most Western markets. The weaker demand for teas in the higher price bracket has had a cascading impact for prices at the lower end, which to some extent stabilized from the previous week's levels often at firm to marginally easier levels.\nHigh & Medium Grown CTC teas too followed a similar trend and witnessed a bearish sentiment, whilst the corresponding Low Grown types continued to witness a reasonably stable price structure.\nLess activity from shippers to the UK, the continent, South Africa and perhaps China as well, whilst shippers to the Middle East and CIS were active at lower levels.\nLow Growns comprised of 1.7 M/Kgs. All categories met with fair demand.\nIn the Leafy and Semi-Leafy catalogues, Select Best BOP1's were not available. However, the Best together with the Below Best and bolder varieties maintained, whilst teas at the bottom too followed a similar trend. High-priced OP1's were easier, whilst the balance in general were firm. Leafier OP's in general were easier, whilst the shorter varieties maintained. Well-made OPA's were firm, whilst the balance were easier following quality.\nHigh priced PEK's were dearer, whilst the Best, Below Best and clean leaf teas at the bottom were easier. Well-made PEK1's were firm, whilst the balance were easier.\nFBOP's, in general, were firm to dearer.  Select Best and Best FF1's declined, whilst the Below Best together with the clean leaf teas at the bottom were firm to dearer. The balance were irregular.\nIn the Premium catalogue, Very Tippy teas were firm to dearer, whilst the Best and Below Best too followed a similar trend. The balance were irregular following quality.\nNOTE\nThere will be no Auctions next week. Sale No. 1 of 2025 will be held on Tuesday, 7 and Wednesday, 8 January with a quantity of 6.0 M/Kgs (12,145 Lots) on offer.\nSRI LANKA TEA PRODUCTION - NOVEMBER 2024\nNovember 2024/2023/2022\n* Sri Lanka Tea Production for the month of November 2024 totalled 22.30 M/Kgs, recording an increase of 2.52 M/Kgs vis-à-vis 19.78 M/Kgs of November 2023. All Elevations have recorded an increase in comparison with the corresponding month of 2023.\n* Compared to 20.36 M/Kgs of November 2022, the corresponding month in 2024 shows an increase of 1.94 M/Kgs (Refer table below).\nJanuary-November 2024/2023/2022\n* January-November 2024 cumulative production totalled 240.01 M/Kgs, recording an increase of 3.74 M/Kgs vis-à-vis 236.28 M/Kgs of January-November 2023. Compared to the corresponding period in 2023, High Growns have shown a negative variance, whilst the Medium Growns and Low Growns gained in the year 2024.\n* Compared to 232.13 M/Kgs of January-November 2022, cumulative production of 2024 shows an increase of 7.88 M/Kgs.
