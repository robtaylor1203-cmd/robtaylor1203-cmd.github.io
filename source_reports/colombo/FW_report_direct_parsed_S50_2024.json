In general, there was fair demand, whilst there was an easier trend in prices for most varieties of tea with a fairly significant decline being recorded for the High & Medium liquoring BOP/BOPF grades.\nEx-Estate offerings totalled 0.93 M/Kgs, up from a 0.88 M/Kgs on offer the previous week. Overall quality of teas from the Western slopes were lower to last, whilst teas from the Eastern sector showed no significant change.\nBest Western BOP/BOPF's had on offer a few select invoices which sold around last week's levels, whilst the majority declined by up to Rs. 100 per kg. In the Below Best category, BOP/BOPF's - particularly in the higher price bracket - declined by Rs. 50 per kg and more. At the lower end, BOP's declined by Rs. 50-100 per kg, whilst the corresponding BOPF's declined by Rs. 20-40 per kg and more as the sale progressed. Nuwara Eliya BOP/BOPF's were mostly unsold.

Low Grown varieties - BP1's continued to sell well, whilst the PF1's too sold reasonably well around last week's levels.\nNo doubt a disappointing sale, particularly for the liquoring teas!!\nLess activity from shippers to the CIS, whilst the other traditional markets too were fairly selective and in general, the intensity of buying was less.\nLow Growns comprised of 2.3 M/Kgs. All categories met with fair demand.\nIn the Leafy and Semi-Leafy catalogues, Select Best BOP1's were easier, whilst the Best varieties together with the Below Best and bolder varieties maintained.

Well-made OP's were easier, whilst the Below Best and teas at the bottom together with the shorter varieties declined sharply. High-priced OPA's were easier, whilst the balance maintained.

PEK1's, in general, were irregularly lower.\nFBOP's together with a few Select Best FF1's were firm, whilst the Best and Below Best declined. Cleaner Leaf teas at the bottom were firm to dearer, whilst the balance were irregular.\nIn the Premium catalogue, Very Tippy teas were firm to dearer, whilst the Best and Below Best too followed a similar trend. The balance were irregular following quality.\nNOTE\nNext week's Auction (Sale No. 51) is a one-day auction and is scheduled for Monday, 23 December 2024\nSRI LANKA TEA EXPORTS - NOVEMBER 2024\nKey Highlights:\n* Monthly Exports have been recorded at 20.07 M/Kgs - (Decrease of 1.38 M/Kgs against 2023)\n* F.O.B Value records Rs. 1,718.88 for the month (USD 5.92) - (Decrease of Rs. 6.89 and an increase of USD 0.64 against 2023)\n*\nCumulative Exports recorded 223.22 M/Kgs - (Increase of 2.06 M/Kgs YoY)\n* Cumulative F.O.B Value reaches Rs. 1,769.93 (USD 5.88), recording a Rs. 2.48 decrease and increase of USD 0.45 against the corresponding year-to date period of 2023.\n* Iraq retains the top position amongst leading importer countries of Ceylon Tea for the\ncumulative period in 2024\nNovember 2024/2023\n* Tea Exports for the month of November 2024 totalled 20.07 M/Kgs, showing a negative variance of 1.38 M/Kgs vis-à-vis 21.46 M/Kgs of November 2023.
