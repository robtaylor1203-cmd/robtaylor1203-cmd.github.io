In general, there was fair demand, whilst there was an easier trend in prices for most varieties of tea with a fairly significant decline being recorded for the High & Medium liquoring BOP/BOPF grades.  \n\nEx-Estate offerings totalled 0.93 M/Kgs, up from a 0.88 M/Kgs on offer the previous week. Overall quality of teas from the Western slopes were lower to last, whilst teas from the Eastern sector showed no significant change.\n\nBest Western BOP/BOPF's had on offer a few select invoices which sold around last week's levels, whilst the majority declined by up to Rs. 100 per kg. In the Below Best category, BOP/BOPF's - particularly in the higher price bracket - declined by Rs. 50 per kg and more. At the lower end, BOP's declined by Rs. 50-100 per kg, whilst the corresponding BOPF's declined by Rs. 20-40 per kg and more as the sale progressed. Nuwara Eliya BOP/BOPF's were mostly unsold.

Uva - Select Best BOP invoices declined by Rs. 20-40 per kg, whilst the others declined substantially more. Corresponding BOPF's - Select Best invoices were Rs. 20-40 per kg easier, whilst the others eased further and substantially more by the close.   \n\nHigh & Medium Grown CTC teas - BP1's had hardly any offerings, whilst the PF1's followed a similar trend with prices declining by up to Rs. 50 per kg and more for the better invoices, and to a lesser extent, at the lower end of the market. Low Grown varieties - BP1's continued to sell well, whilst the PF1's too sold reasonably well around last week's levels.\n\nNo doubt a disappointing sale, particularly for the liquoring teas!!\n\nLess activity from shippers to the CIS, whilst the other traditional markets too were fairly selective and in general, the intensity of buying was less.   \n\nLow Growns comprised of 2.3 M/Kgs. All categories met with fair demand.\n\nIn the Leafy and Semi-Leafy catalogues, Select Best BOP1's were easier, whilst the Best varieties together with the Below Best and bolder varieties maintained. Teas at the bottom too followed a similar trend. OP1's, in general, were easier. Well-made OP's were easier, whilst the Below Best and teas at the bottom together with the shorter varieties declined sharply. High-priced OPA's were easier, whilst the balance maintained. Select Best PEK's declined, whilst the Best, Below Best and clean leaf teas at the bottom were easier. PEK1's, in general, were irregularly lower.\n\nFBOP's together with a few Select Best FF1's were firm, whilst the Best and Below Best declined. Cleaner Leaf teas at the bottom were firm to dearer, whilst the balance were irregular.\n\nIn the Premium catalogue, Very Tippy teas were firm to dearer, whilst the Best and Below Best too followed a similar trend. The balance were irregular following quality.\n\n \n\n\nNOTE\n\n Next week's Auction (Sale No. 51) is a one-day auction and is scheduled for Monday, 23 December 2024\n\n                                  \n\n \n\nSRI LANKA TEA EXPORTS - NOVEMBER 2024\n\n \n\nKey Highlights:\n\n* Monthly Exports have been recorded at 20.07 M/Kgs - (Decrease of 1.38 M/Kgs against 2023)\n\n* F.O.B Value records Rs. 1,718.88 for the month (USD 5.92) - (Decrease of Rs. 6.89 and an increase of USD 0.64 against 2023)\n\n* Cumulative Exports recorded 223.22 M/Kgs - (Increase of 2.06 M/Kgs YoY)\n\n* Cumulative F.O.B Value reaches Rs. 1,769.93 (USD 5.88), recording a Rs. 2.48 decrease and increase of USD 0.45 against the corresponding year-to date period of 2023.\n\n* Iraq retains the top position amongst leading importer countries of Ceylon Tea for the cumulative period in 2024\n\n \n\nNovember 2024/2023\n\n* Tea Exports for the month of November 2024 totalled 20.07 M/Kgs, showing a negative variance of 1.38 M/Kgs vis-à-vis 21.46 M/Kgs of November 2023.

In general, there was fair demand, whilst there was an easier trend in prices for most varieties of tea with a fairly significant decline being recorded for the High & Medium liquoring BOP/BOPF grades.  \nEx-Estate offerings totalled 0.93 M/Kgs, up from a 0.88 M/Kgs on offer the previous week. Overall quality of teas from the Western slopes were lower to last, whilst teas from the Eastern sector showed no significant change.\nBest Western BOP/BOPF's had on offer a few select invoices which sold around last week's levels, whilst the majority declined by up to Rs. 100 per kg. In the Below Best category, BOP/BOPF's - particularly in the higher price bracket - declined by Rs. 50 per kg and more. At the lower end, BOP's declined by Rs. 50-100 per kg, whilst the corresponding BOPF's declined by Rs. 20-40 per kg and more as the sale progressed. Nuwara Eliya BOP/BOPF's were mostly unsold. Uda Pussellawa BOP's declined by Rs. 50 per kg and more, whilst the corresponding BOPF's lost up to Rs. 100 per kg. Uva - Select Best BOP invoices declined by Rs. 20-40 per kg, whilst the others declined substantially more. Corresponding BOPF's - Select Best invoices were Rs. 20-40 per kg easier, whilst the others eased further and substantially more by the close.   \nHigh & Medium Grown CTC teas - BP1's had hardly any offerings, whilst the PF1's followed a similar trend with prices declining by up to Rs. 50 per kg and more for the better invoices, and to a lesser extent, at the lower end of the market. Low Grown varieties - BP1's continued to sell well, whilst the PF1's too sold reasonably well around last week's levels.\nNo doubt a disappointing sale, particularly for the liquoring teas!!\nLess activity from shippers to the CIS, whilst the other traditional markets too were fairly selective and in general, the intensity of buying was less.   \nLow Growns comprised of 2.3 M/Kgs. All categories met with fair demand. \nIn the Leafy and Semi-Leafy catalogues, Select Best BOP1's were easier, whilst the Best varieties together with the Below Best and bolder varieties maintained. Teas at the bottom too followed a similar trend. OP1's, in general, were easier. Well-made OP's were easier, whilst the Below Best and teas at the bottom together with the shorter varieties declined sharply. High-priced OPA's were easier, whilst the balance maintained. Select Best PEK's declined, whilst the Best, Below Best and clean leaf teas at the bottom were easier. PEK1's, in general, were irregularly lower.\nFBOP's together with a few Select Best FF1's were firm, whilst the Best and Below Best declined. Cleaner Leaf teas at the bottom were firm to dearer, whilst the balance were irregular.\nIn the Premium catalogue, Very Tippy teas were firm to dearer, whilst the Best and Below Best too followed a similar trend.

In general, there was fair demand, whilst there was an easier trend in prices for most varieties of tea with a fairly significant decline being recorded for the High & Medium liquoring BOP/BOPF grades.  \n\nEx-Estate offerings totalled 0.93 M/Kgs, up from a 0.88 M/Kgs on offer the previous week. Overall quality of teas from the Western slopes were lower to last, whilst teas from the Eastern sector showed no significant change.\n\nBest Western BOP/BOPF's had on offer a few select invoices which sold around last week's levels, whilst the majority declined by up to Rs. 100 per kg. In the Below Best category, BOP/BOPF's - particularly in the higher price bracket - declined by Rs. 50 per kg and more. At the lower end, BOP's declined by Rs. 50-100 per kg, whilst the corresponding BOPF's declined by Rs. 20-40 per kg and more as the sale progressed. Nuwara Eliya BOP/BOPF's were mostly unsold.

Low Grown varieties - BP1's continued to sell well, whilst the PF1's too sold reasonably well around last week's levels.\n\nNo doubt a disappointing sale, particularly for the liquoring teas!!\n\nLess activity from shippers to the CIS, whilst the other traditional markets too were fairly selective and in general, the intensity of buying was less.   \n\nLow Growns comprised of 2.3 M/Kgs. All categories met with fair demand.\n\nIn the Leafy and Semi-Leafy catalogues, Select Best BOP1's were easier, whilst the Best varieties together with the Below Best and bolder varieties maintained. Teas at the bottom too followed a similar trend. OP1's, in general, were easier.

Select Best PEK's declined, whilst the Best, Below Best and clean leaf teas at the bottom were easier. PEK1's, in general, were irregularly lower.\n\nFBOP's together with a few Select Best FF1's were firm, whilst the Best and Below Best declined. Cleaner Leaf teas at the bottom were firm to dearer, whilst the balance were irregular.\n\nIn the Premium catalogue, Very Tippy teas were firm to dearer, whilst the Best and Below Best too followed a similar trend.

The remainder met with a fairly good demand but eased in value compared to last. BLF teas met with an improved demand with a little less withdrawals.\nFANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings met with a good demand but were mostly a little easier. Their Mediums and plainer varieties met with quite a fair demand and were generally firm on last except for the plainest which were an easier market. BLF teas met with an improved demand with a little less withdrawals.\nDUST: 11,017 packages of tea on offer met with a fairly good demand. Good liquoring Dusts sold well at around last\n levels. Mediums were an easier market by Tk.5/- to Tk.10/- following quality. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and had more withdrawals than last. Blenders were supportive whilst Loose tea buyers were selective.\nCOMMENTS: Offerings in this week's sale were slightly inferior in quality and these met with less competition particularly towards the close when withdrawals were also quite heavy except for the good varieties.

The remainder met with a fairly good demand but eased in value compared to last. BLF teas met with an improved demand with a little less withdrawals.\n\nFANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings met with a good demand but were mostly a little easier. Their Mediums and plainer varieties met with quite a fair demand and were generally firm on last except for the plainest which were an easier market. BLF teas met with an improved demand with a little less withdrawals.\n\nDUST: 11,017 packages of tea on offer met with a fairly good demand. Good liquoring Dusts sold well at around last\n\n levels. Mediums were an easier market by Tk.5/- to Tk.10/- following quality. Plain and BLF Dusts were an easier market and had more withdrawals than last. Blenders were supportive whilst Loose tea buyers were selective.\n\nCOMMENTS: Offerings in this week's sale were slightly inferior in quality and these met with less competition particularly towards the close when withdrawals were also quite heavy except for the good varieties. Blenders were the mainstay of the market but the Loose tea buyers were subdued.\n\nGood liquoring Dusts were the main attraction of the market.\n\nOur Catalogue: (Sale 32) Avg : Tk 213.97, Sold 59.74% , (Sale 31) Avg : Tk 216.40, Sold 67.85%.\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nBROKENS\n\n\t\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n          1.89-1.93\n\n\t\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n             1.89-1.93\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n1.81-1.85\n\n\t\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n1.81-1.85\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n1.64-1.72\n\n\t\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n1.64-1.72\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n1.43-1.51\n\n\t\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n1.43-1.51\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.34-1.36\n\n\t\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.34-1.36\n\nCourtesry - National Brokers Limited\n\n\n "

In general, there was fair demand, whilst there was an easier trend in prices for most varieties of tea with a fairly significant decline being recorded for the High & Medium liquoring BOP/BOPF grades.\nEx-Estate offerings totalled 0.93 M/Kgs, up from a 0.88 M/Kgs on offer the previous week. Overall quality of teas from the Western slopes were lower to last, whilst teas from the Eastern sector showed no significant change.\nBest Western BOP/BOPF's had on offer a few select invoices which sold around last week's levels, whilst the majority declined by up to Rs. 100 per kg. In the Below Best category, BOP/BOPF's - particularly in the higher price bracket - declined by Rs. 50 per kg and more. At the lower end, BOP's declined by Rs. 50-100 per kg, whilst the corresponding BOPF's declined by Rs. 20-40 per kg and more as the sale progressed. Nuwara Eliya BOP/BOPF's were mostly unsold.

Low Grown varieties - BP1's continued to sell well, whilst the PF1's too sold reasonably well around last week's levels.\nNo doubt a disappointing sale, particularly for the liquoring teas!!\nLess activity from shippers to the CIS, whilst the other traditional markets too were fairly selective and in general, the intensity of buying was less.\nLow Growns comprised of 2.3 M/Kgs. All categories met with fair demand.\nIn the Leafy and Semi-Leafy catalogues, Select Best BOP1's were easier, whilst the Best varieties together with the Below Best and bolder varieties maintained. Teas at the bottom too followed a similar trend. OP1's, in general, were easier.

Cleaner Leaf teas at the bottom were firm to dearer, whilst the balance were irregular.\nIn the Premium catalogue, Very Tippy teas were firm to dearer, whilst the Best and Below Best too followed a similar trend.
