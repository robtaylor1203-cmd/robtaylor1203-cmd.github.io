Low Grown/Large Leaf teas continued to meet with good demand, whilst the High & Medium Grown liquoring BOP/BOPF's witnessed a price stabilisation.\nEx-Estate offerings were similar to last and totalled 0.9 M/Kgs.\nOverall quality of the better teas continued to show a decline and consequently, the availability of fair average quality teas continued to increase. In this backdrop, price realisations this week could be considered reasonably satisfactory for the time of year. It was encouraging to observe BOP's at the lower end of the market recording an appreciation following several weeks of weak demand. The corresponding BOPF's too were reasonably maintained subject to fluctuations following quality which could also be considered an encouraging factor amidst the increased volumes on offer.\nHigh Grown CTC teas - BP1's continued to meet with reasonably good demand. PF1's, here again, the better teas perhaps weakened following quality, whilst prices for the others were reasonably maintained. Corresponding Low Growns - BP1's continued sluggish, whilst the PF1's continued to witness a firm to dearer trend.\nImproved activity from shippers to Japan, China and South Africa. Selective buying perhaps from the UK, whilst shippers to the CIS and the Middle East were active at lower levels.\nLow Growns comprised of 2.5 M/Kgs and met with fair demand.\nIn the Leafy and Semi-Leafy catalogues, BOP1's in general together with the select Best OP1's declined, whilst the Best, Below Best and teas at the bottom appreciated. Select Best OP's were easier, whilst the balance sold at last week's levels. Select Best OPA's appreciated, whilst the balance were firm. PEK's, in general declined, whilst the teas at the bottom were firm. A selection of high-priced PEK1's appreciated, whilst the balance sold around last levels.\nIn the Tippy catalogue, well-made FBOP's together with cleaner Below Best and cleaner teas at the bottom were firm, whilst the balance together with bolder varieties were easier. FBOPF1's, in general, were firm to dearer.\nIn the Premium catalogue, Very Tippy teas were firm.
