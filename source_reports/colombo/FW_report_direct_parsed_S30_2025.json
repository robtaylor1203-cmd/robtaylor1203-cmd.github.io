Teas at the bottom remained steady. Well-made OP1's continued to sell at last levels, whilst the balance were irregular. Well-made OP's were firm, whilst the cleaner Below Best and shorter leaf varieties were irregular. The balance sold around last levels. High-priced OPA's maintained, whilst the balance were irregular. Select Best PEK's remained firm, whilst the Best, mixed/open leaf types and teas at the bottom were easier. Overall, PEK1's appreciated.\n\nIn the Tippy catalogue, FBOP's in general were firm, whilst the bolder varieties were irregular following quality.

Medium teas also followed a similar trend. Plain teas also met with much less demand and there were more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with a fairly good demand and were firm to occasionally dearer.\n\nFANNINGS: Good liquoring Fannings met with a good demand but prices eased over last as the sale progressed. Medium and plain varieties met with less demand with more withdrawals. BLF teas continued to meet with a fairly good demand and were firm to occasionally dearer.\n\nDUST: 13,116 packages of tea on offer met with a fair demand. Good liquoring Dusts were irregular and sold at easier levels. Mediums sold well at around last levels. Plain/BLF Dusts were an easier market and also saw fair withdrawals. Blenders lent strong support with fair interest from the Loose tea buyers.\n\nCOMMENTS: There was much less competition in this week's sale whereby prices declined over last by a fair margin especially from the second half of the sale. Blenders were the main operators of the sale but held lower limits whilst there was less interest from the Loose tea buyers. As a result, prices declined and there were more withdrawals.\n\nDusts were an easier market.\nOur Catalogue: (Sale 13) Avg : Tk 250.12, Sold 71.80% , (Sale 12) Avg : Tk 250.37, Sold 77.78%\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nBROKENS\n\n\t\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\n\t\n\nFANNINGS\n\n\n\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n2.10-2.18\n\n\t\n\nBest\n\n\t\n\n           2.06-2.14\n\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n2.06-2.09\n\n\t\n\nGood\n\n\t\n\n2.04-2.06\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n2.03-2.06\n\n\t\n\nMedium\n\n\t\n\n2.02-2.03\n\n\n\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n2.01\n\n\t\n\nPlain\n\n\t\n\n2.01\n\n\n\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.40-1.85\n\n\t\n\nBLF\n\n\t\n\n1.40-1.85\n\nCourtesy - NATIONAL BROKERS LIMITED\n\n\n "
