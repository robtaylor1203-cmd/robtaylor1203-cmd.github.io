Lower Mediums and Plainer also followed a dearer trend with the progress of sale, whilst a few browner sorts suffered some withdrawals.\n\nBUYERS: AVT operated on liquoring sorts with fair support from Devgiri on similar SRD grade. HUL showed more interest. TCPL, Indcoserve and KSCSC were selective. Some demand from local Bazaar. Limited Export demand at lower levels.\n\nCourtesy - J.T. COCHIN\n\n\n "
